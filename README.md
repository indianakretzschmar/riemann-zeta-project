The Riemann Zeta function is famous for its connection to the distribution of prime numbers and
inexplicable non-trivial zeros where itâ€™s real part is 1/2. This project explores the Riemann Zeta
function, emphasizing its properties such as its analyticity, singularities, zeros, contour integrals,
and applications of the function.
